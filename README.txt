Description
This mock social network is designed to teach students the types of security vulnerabilities that are commonly found in web applications. 

Types of exploits shown

Installation
Download, install, and run XAMPP (Apache and MySQL). Then, put this directory into htdocs. Navigate to "localhost/itpProject", or whatever this folder is named. The application uses the default installation of XAMPP, and uses the default pre-initialized 'test' database included with the installation. If your installation of XAMPP's MySQL did not include a database named "test", create it before running the webapp.
