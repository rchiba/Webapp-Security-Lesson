            Welcome to catbook! The social network where cats can post updates on their favorite naptimes, catnip, and toaster strudel outfits. We'll use this mock web application to learn about three types of security vulnerabilities that exist in web applications. To begin your lesson, position this window side-by-side with the application window and follow along. You will be encouraged to explore, and if you need tips, just hit the buttons to reveal the answer.
            <button class="btn" onclick="if(window.confirm('Are you ready to become teh haxxorz kitteh?')){document.getElementById('hackerCat').style.display='inline';}">i can haz anzwer?</button>

            <img id="hackerCat" src="img/hackerCat.jpg" style="display:none; margin-top:10px;">
            </p>
            <p>
            First, begin by creating a couple of new accounts for the system using the registration form on the front page. Remember the passwords for at least a couple of the accounts you create, and use one to log into the system using the login menu at the top right of the screen. </p>
            
            <p>Once you are logged in, you will see your profile page. Create a couple of posts using the text box and post button. You can see all of the cats in the system in the navigation bar at the top of the screen. You can browse through their profiles, but they do not have any posts yet. </p>
            
            <p>Go ahead and log out, and log in as another user. Create a couple of posts, and then navigate to the first user you logged in as. You will be able to see their posts, but should not be able to post to their page. This is the extent of this simple web application. Now that we have explored the app, let's consider the three types of vulnerabilities we will be examining:

            <br>
            
            <h4>What is XSS?</h4>
            <p>
                XSS (Cross Site Scripting) is defined as "<i>a type of computer security vulnerability typically found in Web applications that enables attackers to inject client-side script into Web pages viewed by other users</i>". In essence, it is <b>a way an attacker can trick another user's browser to run arbitrary client-side code</b>. 
            </p>
            <br>
            
            <h4>Why is XSS important?</h4> 
            <p>
                According to Symantec, XSS attacks accounted for about <b>80%</b> of all documented security vulnerabilities in 2007. Although it has been a number of years since, these types of vulnerabilities are still common, are easy to miss by an impatient developer, and can lead to dangerous security holes. If an attacker can find a way to execute arbitrary client-side code on another user's machine, the possibilities are catastrophic: <b>the attacker could gain private information, account access, and can even write code that may self-propagate throughout a system</b>. 
            </p>
            <br>
            
            <h4>What is a typical XSS exploit scenario?</h4> 
            <p>
                Say there are two users of a banking web application, Mittens and Felix, the attacker. Inside the web application, you can search the site for a specific page using a search input field. When a user searches, the search query is displayed on the page before the results. Say the web application programmer forgot to escape the query before printing it on the results screen. Felix can then craft a search URL where the query is his malicious javascript that can read and send the current user's session cookie to Felix's server. Felix can then send the link to Mittens, upon which Mittens will open the page and execute Felix's code on her logged-in client. Felix will then receive Mittens' session cookie, and can now use it to use the banking site as if he were Mittens.
            </p>
            <br>
            
            <h4>How is catbook&#8482 affected?</h4> 
            <p>
                Suppose a hacker cat decides to find a way to run arbitrary scripts on other user's computers. How would she do this? 
                <br>
                
            </p>

            <br>
            <div class="alert-message block-message info" style="margin-top:12px; display:none" id="ans2">
                <p>
                     One possible <strong>non-persistent XSS attack</strong> is on the homepage (index.php). After you create a new user, or when you log out, you can see that a "msg" url parameter signals to the page what should be printed out in the alert. If we insert code instead of a message in this parameter, when it prints inside the alert, it will be executed: 
                     <pre>
                     http://localhost/itpProject/index.php?msg=%3Cscript%3Ealert%28%22hello%22%29%3C%2Fscript%3E</pre> If this contaminated URL is passed to another user, arbitrary Javascript can be executed on their machine. Note that this appears to only work on Firefox. IE, Chrome, and Safari appear to sense that code is in the url parameter and prevent its execution.
                    <br><br>
                    One possible <strong>persistent XSS attack</strong> is by using the posts of one's own profile to store code. Say we post the following on our own profile:
                    <pre class="prettyprint">&ltscript&gtalert(document.cookie);&lt/script&gt</pre>
                    If another user looks at our profile, which will have a perfectly normal URL unlike the case before, the arbitrary Javascript will execute. If we were true attackers, instead of printing out the session cookie, we could have sent it to our own server using an image request with cookie embedded in the filename, allowing our server to receive the session cookie.
                    <br><br><br>
                    <strong>How could we have prevented this?</strong>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                    As a web application programmer, the best way to prevent this attack would have been to escape any input strings to the web app and validating any HTML input. In addition, a web app programmer can tie IP addresses to cookies so that even if a cookie was stolen in an XSS attack, the attacker would not be able to use it to enter into another user's session (at least without knowing the IP address of the user they stole the cookie from).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    As a web application user, the best way to prevent others from XSS'ing you are to disable scripts (using a plugin like NoScript)

            <h2 id="accessControl">Access Control <small>Lesson 2</small></h2>
            <br>
            <h4>What is Access Control?</h4>
            <p>
                Access Control is defined as "<i>exerting control over who can interact with a resource.</i>". In web applications, the resources are often private data and administrative actions, and they are usually controled using some sort of role-based priviledge.
            </p>
            <br>
            
            <h4>Types of access control attacks?</h4>
            <p>
                <b>Vertical Priviledge Escalation</b> occurs when the user can perform functions that they are not allowed to.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Horizontal Priviledge Escalation</b> occurs when the user can view/modify resources they have no permission to.
            </p>
            <p>
                If a developer is careless, they may leave sensitive functionality completely unprotected. Whether it be an obscure administrative URL, a direct access to a resource on a server, or even hidden client-side functionality, the mistakes that can comprimise access control are many.
            </p>
            <br>
            
            <h4>How is catbook&#8482 affected?</h4>
            <p>
                Suppose a hacker cat wants to find a way to gain posting priviledges for other cats. What would she do?

            <button class="btn" onclick="if(window.confirm('Are you sure you want to see teh answer?')){document.getElementById('ans3').style.display='';}">i can haz anzwer?</button>
            
            <div class="alert-message block-message info" style="margin-top:12px; display:none" id="ans3">
                    <b>Attack 1</b>
                    <br>
                    One answer lies in the <b>inline javascript contained within profile.php</b>. Notably, the function that begins with<pre class="prettyprint">/*var*/ insertPost = function(first){</pre>
                    <p>
                    Here, we see a function left in all of the profile pages that allows us to insert posts into other cat's profile pages. Now that we have found it, how do we call it? 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                    First, open the javascript console on your machine. On Chrome for PC, it's "ctrl+shift+j", but searching for "javascript console"+"name of browser" will reveal how to do it on your machine. Now, from the console, simply call <pre class="prettyprint">insertPost('I haxxored you');</pre> from the profile page you want to hack. This will cause the hidden javascript to run, sending a POST to the server to save a post for this profile.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                    <b>Attack 2</b>
                    <br>
                    Another way to escalate priviledges is to look into <b><a href="http://localhost/itpProject/robots.txt" target="_blank">robots.txt</a></b>. Here, one will see that a certain administrative webpanel is hidden at an unprotected, obscure URL, namely, <pre>http://localhost/itpProject/obscurePath/admin.php</pre>
                    By using this webpanel, we can make further exploits, namely some SQL injection attacks. Read the next lesson to learn more about SQL injection.
                    
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <strong>How could we have prevented this?</strong>
                    <br>
                    The best way to prevent this attack would have been to only allow this script to be sent to the client when it is the user's own page. In addition, the insertPost.php script should check the session cookie and validate that the current session's username is the same as the username sent in the post request. That way, even if a POST request is made to the server, it will reject it if the user is not logged in on that session.
                    <br><br>
                    <p>

                    In general, a web application programmer must never rely on:
                    <ul>
                    <li><b>Obscurity</b> - hiding client-side functionality will not keep it away from those who view the source.</li>
                    <li><b>User-Submitted parameters</b> - if they are tied to access rights, then your access rights can be manipulated by an attacker.</li>
                    <li><b>Requests</b> - Data sent to the server can be easily tampered with.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>

            <h4>What is SQL Injection?</h4>
            <p>
                SQL Injection is defined as "<i>inputting SQL statements in a web form to get a badly designed website to perform operations on the database</i>".
            </p>
            <br>
            
            <h4>Why is SQL Injection important?</h4> 
            <p>
                SQL Injection is so dangerous for a web application because an attack on a database may comprimise very sensitive information (credit card numbers, social security numbers, etc), and modifications to a database may bring an entire system down, or even cause it to behave maliciously.
            </p>
            <br>
            
            <h4>How is catbook&#8482 affected?</h4> 
            <p>
                Like any web application, catbook must write to and read from a database to store its users and their posts. 
                Suppose a hacker cat wants to find all the entries in the table of users. How would they go about it?

            <div class="alert-message block-message info" style="margin-top:12px; display:none" id="ans1">
                <p>
                     <b>Try using some of these:</b>
                     <p>
                     <ul>
                        <li>This query uses a OR 'x'='x' statement to trick the getPost.php script into returning all the posts in the table.<pre class="prettyprint">http://localhost/itpProject/getPost.php?username='%20OR%20'x'='x</pre></li>
                        <li>In the administrative panel unlocked in Lesson 2, there is a search users function that allows you to search for a user. If you type in <pre>'</pre>, the following will print out <pre class="prettyprint">Could not successfully run SELECT username FROM members WHERE username=''';</pre> This gives us a clue as to what to do next. We can inject the following SQL statement to get all the users:<pre class="prettyprint">' OR 'x'='x</pre>Following that, the next step we might take is to find what columns are part of the table we are attacking. To do this, we use the INFORMATION_SCHEMA table and craft the following query: <pre class="prettyprint">' OR 'x'='x' UNION SELECT COLUMN_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS WHERE TABLE_NAME='members</pre>By observing the last few print statements that are being outputted, we can see that there is a column called "pword" that is storing the passwords. Now, we can craft a query to target that column and get all the users AND their passwords (the last half the the print statements will be the passwords: <pre class="prettyprint">' OR 'x'='x' UNION ALL SELECT pword FROM members WHERE 'x'='x</pre> Pretty handy!</li>
                     </ul>
                     </p>
                     <br>
                    <strong>How could we have prevented this?</strong>
                    <br>
                    The best way to prevent SQL injections is to sanitize all data coming into the system. To do this, we can filter out all hazardous characters such as the single quote, double quote, slash, backslash, semicolon, NULL, new line, etc. We can do this recursively until all possible hazardous tokens have been purged from the query.
